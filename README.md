# Fashion-MNIST

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow/Keras to classify images from the [Fashion MNIST dataset](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist).

##  Overview

Fashion MNIST is a dataset of Zalando's article imagesâ€”consisting of 70,000 grayscale images in 10 categories. Each image is 28x28 pixels.

The CNN model is trained to recognize the following classes:
- T-shirt/top
- Trouser
- Pullover
- Dress
- Coat
- Sandal
- Shirt
- Sneaker
- Bag
- Ankle boot

## Model Architecture

The CNN includes:
- 2D Convolutional Layers
- Max Pooling
- Dropout
- Fully Connected Dense Layers
- Softmax output
